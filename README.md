Picorder is a set of python programs that provide functionality for the TR-108 Tricorder I am building.

It uses a number of modules to operate, specifically:

Pygame
Senshat
RPi.GPIO
sys
time
math
random 
os

The PC demo also requires 
pyowm

Be sure you have these modules installed before attempting to run this program.

As of this commit there is only one screen with no support for video playback but that is coming. Later commits will also include construction documents (dimensioned drawings, SVGs of the background etc) More details to come as the project is completed.
